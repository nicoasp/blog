For me personally, faith is one of the most curious things in the realm of spirituality. Full disclosure up front: my faith is somewhat shaky as of this writing.

## What is faith in modern spirituality?

In classic religion, faith meant both believing in some kind of God and usually also believing in a certain story told by the relevant religious authority. For example in Christianity, God is a sort of father figure who is the creator of humankind, at some point He sent his son Jesus to save us, and if you are good you will go to heaven when you die.

In most of the modern spirituality I’ve experienced, the word “faith” is not a popular one. However there is a widespread kind of trust in life, a type of optimism and belief that, although there is definitely suffering in the world, ultimately there is some sort of higher Good that is the deepest real thing.

I’d generalise the (often unspoken) mental model of faith in modern spirituality as something like this: The universe is not just random mutations and natural selection, but rather there is some kind of soul or spirit. There is some kind of divine presence that permeates all things and it is a loving, benevolent presence. The way you experience this presence is very personal, you may experience it as a sort of single being, God, whose presence is in all things (so this fits with monotheistic religions), or you can experience it as a more decentralised aliveness and beauty that is in all nature (which would fit for example with a more pagan spirituality).

Personally I like this mental model. We could definitely get into lots of deep arguments about it. For example, if there is a loving divine presence in all things, why is there suffering? Why is there evil? There are ways to try to conceptualise this if you wish to, which I don’t now (except maybe through a foot note?).

## Direct experience over belief

Regardless of the infinite intellectual discussions we could have about this theory of faith, one great thing about (the good kinds of) modern spirituality is that they often focus more on direct experience than belief. For example, through practices such as meditation, conscious dance, or prayer, you can experience a sense of “being connected” (to life / the universe / god). The beautiful invitation is that you’re not asked to mentally believe a story (such as whatever the church says) but rather you are invited to see if you directly experience a sense of connectedness.

I myself have had incredibly deep and touching experiences. In fact here I would like to leave scepticism behind for a moment and actually risk sharing with you some of the most sacred experiences I’ve ever had, which is quite vulnerable: on a few different occasions I was part of a large group making a sort of humming sound together, and I had an unequivocal feeling of being touched by a divine presence, and I cried deeply for a long time. These tears were different from normal tears: somehow they had the power to wash through my entire being and tensions or emotional wounds I might have held for years were just dissolved like rain dissolves a snowman.

As a consequence of these experiences as well as several others, I spent a few years of my life with a strong belief in the paradigm I described above: that generally there is a loving, divine presence. It’s quite beautiful to live with such a belief. It can be a huge source of optimism and resilience. In fact this faith actually gave me strength to work through traumas and wounds that I was sure I would never dare to open up.

## A sceptical look

As I’ve mentioned before, I see scepticism as a beautiful thing, as long as it’s humble scepticism without an agenda, which is very different from cynicism. So: you could say the only thing that is really proven by the experiences I just described is that we human beings have the capacity to feel emotionally touched and to experience catharsis. Especially when connecting to each other and when choosing to be vulnerable together. But did this prove that there is a God or divine presence, or is that just how I chose to interpret my experience? And in turn, how much of how I interpreted my experience was guided and influenced by my teacher and the shared beliefs of my community?

I mentioned earlier that “faith” and “belief” are not popular words in the communities I’ve been a part of, and I think most members of these communities would tell you that they don’t have any belief, only direct experience. My own opinion now is that most of them underestimate how much they do indeed interpret their experience and how much they rely on the teacher or guru for their conviction. For myself, I can certainly say that a large part of my faith in the past was heavily reliant on my teacher.

I’m not sure that’s a bad thing. As I mentioned before, faith allowed me to face and heal a great deal of trauma and enjoy a lot of personal development. On the other hand there is definitely a danger in faith which is fundamentalism, being convinced that you are in possession of the truth… and I’ve definitely seen that too, even in the most “advanced”, loving and ethical groups I’ve been a part of.

## My own search and a (partial?) crisis of faith

Recently I decided to go on a solo darkness retreat. My wish was to have an unguided experience, to explore consciousness myself without the guidance of any teacher and find my own truths. I experienced many things during the retreat, amongst them a great Peace. Now, I also really wished to experience a connection with God. And I seeked it. I humbly prayed and requested or invited the sense of presence of God. And to be honest with you: on this occasion, I did not experience a clear answer. I did have a sense of Aliveness in all things. But there was no overwhelming sense of certainty in a divine, benevolent presence.

So there you go, that’s my most recent truth. If I’m honest, I’m not certain right now that there is indeed some kind of larger benevolent presence that is present in all things.

Certainly all the suffering you see in the news does not seem to indicate such a Presence. And here’s another argument: as you can probably tell, although I’m putting all these things in doubt, obviously I still at least partly believe in this benevolent presence I’m talking about right? But how much of that is just my privilege? I’m a very privileged person, I have a safe, comfortable life and loved ones around me. So even if I do experience a sense of blessing, well, does that indicate a benevolent presence in all things or just that I’m a lucky individual and there is benevolence in my direct experience?

## A beautiful paradox

Now the fascinating thing is: I think faith is a bit like romantic love, or love of any other kind. Imagine you are in conflict with a loved one. When you look at them with mistrust, rarely will they respond by showing you unequivocal proof of their genuineness and goodness… you’ll usually find mistrust and reservation right back. When you instead offer them love and openness, you’re also more likely to find it in return.

I think faith is a bit like that. When you can’t find faith and what you want is proof, it probably won't come. If there is a god or divine presence, I believe He/She is totally fine with you not having faith. In fact you have the power to open and close to faith as much as you wish, which I think is quite nice and healthy.

On the other hand… I have indeed found that when honestly in my heart I’ve felt a sense of love and devotion and faith, my faith has “loved me back”. I’m not talking about good things happening to me or anything like that, just having a feeling inside that “the universe loves me back”. One way to explain that could be: if god is in all things, then it’s also in me, so of course when I love I feel god’s love, because it’s my own love.

Whatever you think, even if this is all just chemical reactions inside our bodies, I do find it beautiful that this is at least a possible experience for humans: To feel love and hope in our hearts, and to experience some sense of faith or trust that this hope is founded because the universe is good.
